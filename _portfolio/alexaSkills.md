Alexa "Skills" built with AWS Lambda and Node.js
* [See code on Github](https://github.com/mikeMedis/alexa-facts-skill){:target="_blank"}  AND  [also here](https://github.com/mikeMedis/alexa-facts-skill){:target="_blank"}

## Explanation

This project was the design and development of two Alexa Skills with Node.js that are published in the Alexa Skill Store and are free to the public.

## Problem

Wanting my Amazon Echo to be more customized to me and my style. I would have to develop the "skills" I wanted my Amazon Echo to be capable of performing.Most of Alexa's skills were either based off another developer's idea or they were more of the basic out of the box "skills" developed by the Alexa team at Amazon.

## Solution

The "skills" were developed with AWS Lambda and Node.js. Searching the new world of open source Alexa Skills development, I came across a well curated Node.js following of developers. I used a widely adopted section of code called Alexa-App. Alexa-app took the development protocol put in place by Amazon and has organized the process in a nice and neat fashion. I created a custom fact and trivia "skill", both based on a computer programming theme. Computer Facts reads a random fact from a list on facts in the skill. Computer Trivia reads a computer programming question and four possible answers, the user will provide Alexa with a desired choice then move on to the next question until 5 questions have been asked then Alexa will prompt the user to start another round of questioning or to choose another command.

## Conclusion

After development and testing, the skills were all sent to the Alexa certification team. The "skills" were then published to the Alexa Skills store and offered to the public for free.
