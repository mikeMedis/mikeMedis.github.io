## Explanation

This project was the design and development of two Alexa Skills with Node.js that are published in the Alexa Skill Store and are free to the public.

## Problem

Wanting my Amazon Echo to be more customized to me and my style. I would have to develop the "skills" I wanted my Amazon Echo to be capable of performing. Most of Alexa's skills were either based off another developer's idea or they were more of a basic out of the box "skill" developed by the Alexa team at Amazon.

## Solution

The "skills" were developed with AWS Lambda and Node.js. Searching the new world of open source Alexa "Skills" development, I came across a well curated Node.js following of developers. I used a widely adopted section of code called Alexa-App. Alexa-app took the development protocol put in place by Amazon and has organized the process in a nice and neat fashion. I created a custom fact and trivia "skill", both based on a computer programming theme. Computer Facts reads a random fact from a list of prewritten facts in the skill. Computer Trivia refers to a randomized computer programming question and four possible answers. The user provides Alexa with a desired choice. Alexa prompts the user to the next question until 5 questions have been asked. The user finally has the decision to move to another round of questions or to exit the "skill".

## Conclusion

After the development and testing section, the "skills" needed to be sent to the Alexa certification team. After twenty-four hours the "skills" were published to the Alexa "skills" store and offered to the public for free.
