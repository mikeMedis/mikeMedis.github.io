## Explanation

I designed and developed a two Alexa Skills that are published on the Alexa Skill store.

## Problem

I wanted my amazon echo to be more customized to me and my style. Most of Alexa's skills were either based off another developers ideas or they were more of the basic out of the box skills developed by the Alexa team at Amazon.

## Solution

The skills were developed with AWS Lambda and NodeJS.  I created a custom facts and trivia Skill both based on a computer programming theme. Computer Facts reads a random fact from a list on facts in the skill. Computer Trivia reads a computer programming question and four possible answers, the user will provide Alexa with a desired choice then move on to the next question until 5 questions have been asked then Alexa will prompt the user to start another round of questioning or to choose another command. T

## Conclusion

The skills were all sent to the Alexa certification team and then published to the Alexa Skills Store.
