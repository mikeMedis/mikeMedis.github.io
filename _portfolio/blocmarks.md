BlocMarks is a social bookmarking application for finding and sharing your favorite URLs with your friends online

## Explanation

With a native browser sharing your favorite bookmarks with friend and family isn't the easiest thing to do that why I would like to introduce you to BlocMarks. BlocMarks makes sharing your favorite bookmarked sites with your friends a very simple job. Organizing each bookmark by topic and making them public other users can find and use your favorite bookmarks with ease.

## Problem

It is easy enough to bookmark a URL in your browser, but eventually your bookmark library may get cluttered and it may require effort to manage bookmarks. It would be nice to have the ability to share bookmarks with friends. That is not something you can do easily from your native browser.

## Solution

The BlocMarks application will solve this problem so that users can have their own bookmarks organized by topic as well as have them shared to other users adding the ability to like and dislike as well.

## Results

Achieving the desired results, I first used Devise a ruby gem to have a user sign up and authentic who they were in order to gain access in to the web application.

## Conclusion

Passing all parameters of the user stories given for the application. The problem was solved and now a Bookmark sharing application is in place.
