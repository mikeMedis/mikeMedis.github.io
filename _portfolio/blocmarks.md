## Explanation

With a native browser sharing your favorite bookmarks with friend and family isn't the easiest thing to do that why I would like to introduce you to BlocMarks. BlocMarks makes sharing your favorite bookmarked sites with your friends a very simple job. Organizing each bookmark by topic and making them public other users can find and use your favorite bookmarks with ease.

## Problem

Bookmarks are all private to each users own computer and for time to time get very cluttered and disorganized.

## Solution

To make a application that users can have their own bookmarks organized by topic as well as have them shared to other users adding the ability to like and dislike as well.

## Results

Achieving the desired results, I first used Devise a ruby gem to have a user sign up and authentic who they were in order to gain access in to the web application.
