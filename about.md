Hey There!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I'm going to go ahead and make the assumption that since you are reading this, you would like to learn me about me.

My name is Mike Medis and I am a problem solver. I am software developer, economist, and life long learner. I love being able to solve problems for clients and be able to see their amazing results. Software development is an avenue that I can use my creativity, analytical mindset, and personal style to solve problems and develop one of a kind products for clients and/or my team.

I am always pushing the boundaries of what I know and what I can do and building complex software is a passion of mine.
If you would like to connect, please send me a message via my contact form.

Thanks!
